## Usage 

<!--chapter:end:index.Rmd-->

# Hello bookdown 

All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (`#`) per .Rmd file.

## A section

All chapter sections start with a second-level (`##`) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.

<!--chapter:end:01-intro.Rmd-->

# Lesson 1

Here is my first lesson!

## My first shiny app
```{r setup_lesson1, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("RScripts/L01_Script01_MyFirstApp.R")
knitr::read_chunk("RScripts/L01_Script02_InputExample.R")
knitr::read_chunk("RScripts/L01_Script03_PPSolution01.R")
knitr::read_chunk("RScripts/L01_Script04_PPQuestion02.R")
knitr::read_chunk("RScripts/L01_Script05_PPSolution02.R")
```

My first app
```{r,L01_Script01_MyFirstApp, eval=FALSE}

```

Input example
```{,L01_Script02_InputExample, eval=FALSE}

```

Practice Problem #1 Solution
```{r,L01_Script03_PPSolution01, eval=FALSE}

```

Practice Problem #2 Question
```{r,L01_Script04_PPQuestion02, eval=FALSE}

```

Practice Problem #2 Solution
```{r, L01_Script05_PPSolution02, eval=FALSE}

```

# Parts

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. 

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

# Footnotes and citations 

## Footnotes

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.]. 

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). 
Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.


The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>
